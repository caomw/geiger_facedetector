geiger_facedetector
---------------------------

This is a small demo script based on the face detector tutorial written by Clement Farabet.  I have updated some of the classes to be compatible with the newer version of torch and simplified some of the code to be more friendly to lua newcomers.

Run train_face_detector.lua (in torch) to download the data and run the training.

You will need torch (http://torch.ch/), as well as wget.  This script works on Linux (Ubuntu 64bit tested) and Mac OS X.
